I get to know from document and google that GIT  is Distributed Version Controller.
GIT is a open software.
There is a difference between GIT-HUB code hosting service based on GIT version controller.
GIT-HUB is a paid software sometimes.It is web based host for repositiory.
I learned  to create GIT account.And its use.

I learned following commands in GIT-
1.ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "salonimaheshwari05@gmail.com" :- to assign username.
2.cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub:- to find SSH key and paste on GIT-HUB.

3. for coloning the project I followed these steps:-
i.first right click on the folder location then opened GIT BASH.
ii.then i made a directory batman by command:- mkdir batman and on GIT-HUB i made a repo.
iii.i copied the SSH key form code.
iv.i cloned the batman repo by the same command:-git clone git@github.com:chirag-cybercom/batman.git batman/
v.to move in particular directory-cd directoryname

4.
i.for nickname of repo i used -git remote -v command.
ii.suppose the nickname is origin it will be fetch by-:$ git fetch origin
iii.to check current version:-$ git status
iv.to add the file:-$ git add index.php
v.changes are saved with the name :-$ git commit -m "added echo in index file"
vi.push changes to origin:-$ git push origin batman-bike
vii.switch to origin:-$ git checkout main
viii.to merge the files -$ git merge --no-ff origin/batman-bike


extra command by google:-
git --version:- to check version
git init:- to make a blank repositiory of name git.it is hidden in folder .git
git add . :- to process all files on stage
git log:- who made the changes on which time
git config --global.user.name "saloni" :-assign name of user
git config --global.user.name "salonimaheshwari05@gmail.com" :-assign user email of user
