------:JAVASCRIPT:-----
OBJECTS  AND  FUNCTIONS:-

Everything is an Object.

JAVASCRIPT have two types object and primitive.
Primitives are the data types. like numbers ,strings,booleans,undefined,Null.
Object are other than data types lke array,functions,objects,dates,wrappers for numbers,wrappers for string,wrappers for Booleans.

Object Oriented Programming:-
Objects interacting with one another through methods and properties.

Used to store data,structure applications into modules and keeping code clean.

Constructor or prototype:-
to create objects.we can create as many instances as we want.It is like blue print to create objects.

Inheritance:-
one object is based on other object.


Every JS object has a prototype property,which makes inheritance possible in JS.

The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want other objects to inherit.

The constructor's prototype property is NOT the prototype of the constructor itself,it's the prototype of ALL instances that are created through it.

Prototype:-When a certain method(or property) is called,the search starts in the object itself,and if it cannot be found,the search moves on the object's prototype.this continues until the method is found.



hasOwnProperty():- to check whether the object contains that property.
john.hasOwnProperty('job');
->true


person.prototype:-
to know the properties.


prototype property of the person:-
john._proto_===Person.prototype
->true


instanceof:- it is like question becz it gives true or false.
john instanceof Person
