**********JAVASCRIPT***********

********Classes**********
Classes:-

classes makes easier to implement inheritance to create objects on blue prints.
In ES5 these blue prints are called as function consrtuctor.

static method:-

they are simply attach to class but not inherited by the class instances. 


class defination are not hosited unlike function constructor we have to first implement class and on late code we can use it.

We can only add methods to classes but not properties.


********Classes with Subclasses**********

object.create method allows us to set prototype manually.
